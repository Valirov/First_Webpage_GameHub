ASSIGNMENT:  
Module assignment from my studies at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.
Deliver a responsive version of the homepage based on my design from Design 1.

COMMENT: 
This will only be used for learning purposes in my study to become a better front-end developer.



You need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that you chose in Design 1.

The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. Certain functionality that requires JavaScript can be mimicked for now, for example a log in page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.
The HTML should be semantic and neat.
The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.
Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1.
You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by you. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, and these should be included in your report.
